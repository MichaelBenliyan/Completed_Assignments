# Completed_Assignments
Repo with solutions to the coursework. We can have multiple solutions to each question that way we can take advantage and learn form all of our unique ways of solving a problem. 

# Want to add a solution?
To add a new solution use the same system we use in class. Fork the repo, clone it to your computer, add a new solution in the body of the problem (let's keep our added solutions commented, that way someone looking at the document can uncomment any solution they are interested in), push your changes, create a pull request.
